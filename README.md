# Pokemon Memory Game

Welcome to the Pokémon Memory Game! This is a fun and interactive game built with React where you can test your memory by clicking on Pokémon images. The goal is to click on each Pokémon only once to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- Pokémon Memory Game: Click on Pokémon images to earn points. If you click on a Pokémon more than once, your score resets.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of your current score and high score.
- Randomized Images: The Pokémon images are shuffled each time you make a selection.

## Acknowledgments
- The game uses [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for retrieving Pokémon data and images.
